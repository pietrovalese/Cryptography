# Cryptography
In this repository i will try to re-create a bunch of algorithm to create an application that is cryptographic secure
This repo is composed by:
    -Generator of random seqeunce:
        -BBS_gen.py
        -linear_generator.py
    -Function to check if an integer is prime such as:
   	-Test_Miller_Rabin.py

Pay attention that some script use other script in this repo, so make sure to check the dependency
